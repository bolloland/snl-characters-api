# LIVE from New York...We're building an SNL Character Database, based on the cast members that created them! 

At the moment, we're able to create new Members, look at their characters and give Likes based on our love for them.
Future goals for this app include: a ranking system, detailed info about cast members and characters alike reviews of the best sketches with that character, and a constantly updating real-time list of the Top 5 characters on SNL.
